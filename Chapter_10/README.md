Exercise 10-9 HugeInteger Class
- This class enables the user to create a HugeInteger object that represents an positive integer value
  with up to 40 digits.
    - Objects can be instantied by using integers and strings.
- Overloading arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) enable this class to be used as if it were an integer.
    - These operators can also be overloaded using integers to enable arithemtic between HugeIntegers
      and integers.
Limitations:
    - Can only be used with positive integers
    - Integer overflow or underflow is not represented

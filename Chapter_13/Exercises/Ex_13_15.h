 * @brief Point class definition
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2020-08-01
 * 
 * Exercise 13-15 Point Class
 * 
 * Write a program that accomplishes each of the following:
 * 
 * a) Create a user-defined class Point that contains the private integer data members xCoordinate and yCoordinate
 *    and declares stream insertion and stream extraction overloaded operator functions as friends of the class.
 * 
 * b) Defined the stream insertion and stream extraction operator functions. The stream extraction operator function
 *    should determine whether the data entered is valid, and, if not, should set the failbit to indicate proper
 *    input. The stream insertion operator should not be able to display the point after an input error occured.
 * 
 * c) Write a main function that tests input and output of user-defined class Point, using the overloaded stream
 *    extraction adn stream insertion operators.

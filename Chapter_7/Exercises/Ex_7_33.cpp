/**
 * Exercise 7-33 Maze Traversal
 *
 * There is a simple algorithm for walking through a maze that guarantees finding the exit
 * (assuming there is an exit). If there is not an exit, you'll arrive at the starting location
 * again. Place your right hand on the wall to your right and begin walking forward. Never move
 * your hand from the wall. If the maze turns to the right, you follow the wall to the right.
 * As long as you do not remove your hand from the wall, eventually you'll arrive at the exit
 * of the maze.
 *
 * Write a recursive function mazeTraverse to walk through the maze. The function should
 * receive arguments that include a 12 by 12 built-in array of chars representing the maze
 * and the starting location of the maze. As mazeTraverse attempts to locate the exit from
 * the maze, it should place the character X in each square in the path. The function should
 * display the maze after each move so the user can watch as the maze is solved.
 *
